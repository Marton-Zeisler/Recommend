I developed an educational Swift Playground that teaches and guides users step-by-step on how online recommendation systems work on e-commerce sites.

This playground was chosen among thousands of submissions to be rewarded with an Apple WWDC19 Scholarship, an invitation to an exclusive one-week Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California.
